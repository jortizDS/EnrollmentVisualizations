# UIUC Enrollment Visualization App

## Overview

As a woman in STEM, I often found myself reflecting on the changing makeup of my learning environments. I began my academic journey at an Elementary school in the Southwest side of Chicago, where 99% of students are underprivileged and Hispanic, and later attended Whitney Young, one of the most diverse high schools in the city. The shift to a predominantly white institution (PWI) like UIUC, and the noticeable lack of cultural, ethnic, and gender representation within my majorâ€”made me reflect on how diversity can look very different across academic spaces. That experience led me here. My goal was to turn personal curiosity into a resource that could help others better understand representation across departments.

This [R Shiny web application](https://jortizds-enrollmentvisualizations.share.connect.posit.cloud/) provides interactive visualizations and summaries of student enrollment data at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), filtered by semester, college, degree, major, and concentration. The app helps users explore enrollment trends across demographic dimensions such as race/ethnicity, sex, and residency.

The data covers enrollment from Fall 2004 to Spring 2025, with key changes over time:

- In Summer 2010, a new race/ethnicity classification system was adopted.

- In Fall 2020, data on Underrepresented Minorities (URM) was introduced.

These changes are reflected in the dashboard, which supports dynamic exploration across this full time range.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Make UIUC student enrollment data more accessible and visually intuitive.

- Provide summary statistics and charts to support data-driven decision-making.

- Highlight enrollment distributions by race/ethnicity, underrepresented minority status, sex, and Illinois residency.

## Data Sources

- This dashboard utilizes semester enrollment data sourced from the [Division of Management Information (DMI) - UIUC](https://dmi.illinois.edu/stuenr/#race). The data sets contain demographic records of students by curriculum.


## Process 

1. **Data Ingestion:** Web scraping was used to automatically download the enrollment data in Excel format from the DMI site. 
2. **Data Cleaning:** Data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and relevance, with formatting differences across years standardized during this process.
3. **Dynamic Filtering**: Users can filter data by semester, college, degree, major, and concentration.
4. **Visualizations**: Displays various plots and graphs for enrollment data across key demographic and academic categories.
5. **Data Summary**: Provides a textual summary of enrollment statistics, including totals and breakdowns based on selected filters.
6. **Dashboard Development:** An interactive R Shiny app is created to explore and visualize enrollment data.

## Technologies Used

- R: Main programming language for data processing and Shiny app.

- Shiny: Framework for building the web-based application.

- rvest: Used alongside httr and xml2 for web scraping and downloading Excel files.

- tidyverse: Data manipulation, plotting, and summarization.

- scales: For formatting numbers with commas (e.g., 1,000 instead of 1000).

- DT: Data tables for displaying filtered datasets.
